    'name': 'Field Style',
    'version': '1.0',
    'category': 'web',
    'description': """Allows to specify different colors or 
    CSS class per field in view definition.

    Three new attributes will be available on the field element of a view:
        `bgcolor` for setting the background color
        `fgcolor` for setting the foreground color (basically the text)
        `ccsclass` for setting a custom CSS class to be applied on the field

    `bg/fgcolor` are very useful for people that only want to change some field color without
    having to deal with CSS.

    NOTE: you must apply a simple patch to this server's file

        `server/openerp/addons/base/rng/view.rng`

    Just use the patch provided by this module (see server-view.rng.patch in the root of the package).
